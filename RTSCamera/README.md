# RTSCamera

A project containing my RTS camera that has different preset configurations on it.

List of Dependencies:
---------------------
- The camera is a two part object: It hase the parent with the camera and script on it, and a child which is the 'target' transform.
- Your level/ terrain must be on a 'terrain' layer (can be renamed to w.e you want), this is important for determining the distance from the camera to the terrain.
